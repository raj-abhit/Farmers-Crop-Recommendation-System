# Farmers-Crop-Recommendation-System

# üìò Introduction
Agriculture is crucial for global food security and livelihoods. However, challenges like unpredictable weather, soil degradation, and poor crop selection often hinder optimal productivity. This project introduces an AI-powered crop recommendation system designed to suggest the most suitable crop for cultivation based on environmental and soil conditions.

Unlike traditional machine learning methods, this system utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) particularly effective at recognizing patterns and complex dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for this application.

# üéØ Objectives
Recommend the best crop to cultivate based on input features: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall.

Train and evaluate an LSTM model to classify the optimal crop from a predefined list.

Analyze the model's performance using standard classification metrics:

‚úÖ Accuracy

‚úÖ Precision

‚úÖ Recall

‚úÖ F1-score

‚úÖ Confusion Matrix

This system aims to empower farmers and agricultural planners with data-driven insights, leading to improved crop yields and fostering sustainable farming practices.


# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM model)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Numpy (for numerical operations)

Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)


# üìä Model Evaluation
The model's performance is rigorously assessed using standard classification metrics, which may include:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.

Precision: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.

Recall: The proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.

F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix: A table describing the performance of a classification model.
