# Farmers-Crop-Recommendation-System
# 📘 Introduction
Agriculture is crucial for global food security and livelihoods. However, challenges like unpredictable weather, soil degradation, and poor crop selection often hinder optimal productivity. This project introduces an AI-powered crop recommendation system designed to suggest the most suitable crop for cultivation based on environmental and soil conditions.

Unlike traditional machine learning methods, this system utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) particularly effective at recognizing patterns and complex dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for this application.

# 🎯 Objectives
Recommend the best crop to cultivate based on input features: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall.

Train and evaluate an LSTM model to classify the optimal crop from a predefined list.

Analyze the model's performance using standard classification metrics:

✅ Accuracy

✅ Precision

✅ Recall

✅ F1-score

✅ Confusion Matrix

This system aims to empower farmers and agricultural planners with data-driven insights, leading to improved crop yields and fostering sustainable farming practices.

# 🚀 Getting Started
